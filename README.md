# Stack Overflow (Duplicity) Dataset

This repository publishes two novel datasets for (pre-)training NLP models applicable for software engineering domain.
The datasets were presented in the paper [MQDD – Pre-training of Multimodal Question Duplicity Detection for Software Engineering Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxx),
which contains detailed information about the datasets.
